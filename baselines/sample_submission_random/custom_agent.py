    def select_additional_infos(self) -> EnvInfos:
        """
        Returns what additional information should be made available at each game step.

        Requested information will be included within the `infos` dictionary
        passed to `CustomAgent.act()`. To request specific information, create a
        :py:class:`textworld.EnvInfos <textworld.envs.wrappers.filter.EnvInfos>`
        and set the appropriate attributes to `True`. The possible choices are:

        * `description`: text description of the current room, i.e. output of the `look` command;
        * `inventory`: text listing of the player's inventory, i.e. output of the `inventory` command;
        * `max_score`: maximum reachable score of the game;
        * `objective`: objective of the game described in text;
        * `entities`: names of all entities in the game;
        * `verbs`: verbs understood by the the game;
        * `command_templates`: templates for commands understood by the the game;
        * `admissible_commands`: all commands relevant to the current state;

        In addition to the standard information, game specific information
        can be requested by appending corresponding strings to the `extras`
        attribute. For this competition, the possible extras are:

        * `'recipe'`: description of the cookbook;
        * `'walkthrough'`: one possible solution to the game (not guaranteed to be optimal);

        Example:
            Here is an example of how to request information and retrieve it.

            >>> from textworld import EnvInfos
            >>> request_infos = EnvInfos(description=True, inventory=True, extras=["recipe"])
            ...
            >>> env = gym.make(env_id)
            >>> ob, infos = env.reset()
            >>> print(infos["description"])
            >>> print(infos["inventory"])
            >>> print(infos["extra.recipe"])

        Notes:
            The following information *won't* be available at test time:

            * 'walkthrough'

            Requesting additional infos comes with some penalty (called handicap).
            The exact penalty values will be defined in function of the average
            scores achieved by agents using the same handicap.

            Handicap is defined as follows
                max_score, has_won, has_lost,               # Handicap 0
                description, inventory, verbs, objective,   # Handicap 1
                command_templates,                          # Handicap 2
                entities,                                   # Handicap 3
                extras=["recipe"],                          # Handicap 4
                admissible_commands,                        # Handicap 5
        """
        request_infos = EnvInfos()
        request_infos.admissible_commands = True

        Acts upon the current list of observations.

        One text command must be returned for each observation.

        Arguments:

            value is ignored.ed, e.g. `all(dones)`.

        Notes:
            Commands returned for games marked as `done` have no effect.
            The states for finished games are simply copy over until all
            games are done.
